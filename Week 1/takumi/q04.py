# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers.
def palin(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

largest = 0
for i in range(999, 99, -1):
    for j in range(i, 99, -1):
        product = i * j
        if palin(product) and product > largest:
            largest = product

print(largest)
